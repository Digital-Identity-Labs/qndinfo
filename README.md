# QnDInfo

### A reverse-proxy placeholder container
A very simple Apache and PHP7 container for debugging reverse proxies

Any path will show PHP Info, and all client requests are logged to STDOUT.

Based on Alpine.

This is *not* for use in production: it's helpful for setting up reverse
proxies as a placeholder or as a debugging substitute for real services.
